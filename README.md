# PassLock Desktop
PassLock is a local password storing application for windows. It uses the password you choose to enter the app as the encryption key for all passwords. 

## How to use
You will be greeted with a file dialog asking where you'd like to store the password database. This can be anywhere on your computer or in one drive. 
After you select the storage location, you will be prompted to create a password for your database. This password is used to encrypt all passwords entered in the database, and should be secure, but not something you'd forget, since there is no way of recovering the password.
After that, you'll be greeted with the add a password tab. You need to create an account name, and enter either the email or password or both that you use for the account. You then add the password and optionally, you can add recovery codes using the button provided.
When entering recovery codes, you need to enter them in the text box below the table and press add. You can do this for all rc codes and then press done. If you want to add multiple RC codes at a time you can do so by seperating them with a comma or enter. 
There should not be spaces before or after the code since it will not be removed. If you made a mistake while entering the RC codes, you can click on the faulty code in the table, then a remove button will appear, click it to remove the code.
After at least one password is entered, the home screen will be a Quick view screen showing your most viewed password, most recently viewed password and a favourite password if set.
You can view all passwords by going to the view all tab and searching for the account name or by clicking on the account name you're looking for. 
You will then see all the details for the account which you can copy to clip board by clicking on the detail you want to copy.
From that same page, you can edit the account details or delete the account using the buttons provided.

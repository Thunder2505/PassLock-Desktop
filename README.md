This is a local password storing app for windows. On first launch,  it will ask you where you want to store the db and then ask you for a login password. All asswords are encrypted using the login password, thus, the login password should be secure. 
The first page you'll see is to add you're accounts with their information to the db(RC codes supported but not required). As soon as you have at least one password, the home page will be a quick view of your most frequently used passwords, the last viewed password
and a favourite password that you can set when viewing a password. The View all tab will be populated with buttons with the names that you set for the passwords. When you click on the password, you will see the details, as well as options(Set favourite, delete and edit).
